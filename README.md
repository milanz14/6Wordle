## 🎮 How To Play

- Guess the hidden 6-letter word in 6 tries
- Type your guess into the input field and hit **Guess**
- After each guess, the tiles will flip and change color to show how close you were:

| Color     | Meaning                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| 🟩 Green  | Letter is in the correct position               |
| 🟨 Yellow | Letter is in the word but in the wrong position |
| ⬜ Grey   | Letter is not in the word                       |

- The game ends when you guess the word correctly or run out of tries
- Hit **Play Again** to get a new word and start over

## 🧠 Game Logic

The core game logic lives in `App.tsx` and works as follows:

**Word Selection** — on mount, a random word is selected from the word library and stored in a ref to avoid re-renders affecting it mid-game.

**Guess Validation** — each submitted guess is checked against three rules before being accepted: it must not be empty, it must be exactly 6 letters, and it must exist in the word library. Invalid guesses trigger a shake animation on the input and a toast notification explaining the issue.

**Tile Scoring** — handled in `GuessLine.tsx`. Each letter is compared against the solution: an exact position match gets green, a letter that exists elsewhere in the word gets yellow, and anything else gets grey.

**Win/Loss Detection** — if the guess matches the solution exactly the player wins. If the player exhausts all 6 guesses without a correct answer the game ends in a loss and the solution is revealed.

## 🗂️ Word Library

The game uses a curated list of 6-letter words stored in `src/data/words.ts`. This list serves as both the pool of possible answer words and the set of valid guesses — if a word isn't in the list, it won't be accepted as a guess.

To add more words, simply append them (lowercase) to the array in `words.ts`.

---

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- The word is re-randomised on page refresh, so there is no daily shared word mechanic
- There is no keyboard component — guesses must be typed via the text input
- No guess history is persisted between sessions
